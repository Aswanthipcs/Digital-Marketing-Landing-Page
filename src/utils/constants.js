  {
    title: "1. What is Python, and why is it popular in data science?",
    desc: "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It's popular in data science due to its extensive libraries (like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn), ease of learning, and strong community support. Python's versatility and ability to handle a wide range of data-related tasks make it a preferred choice for data scientists.",
  },
  {
    title: "2. What are the key Python libraries for data science?",
    desc: `Key Python libraries for data science include:
    
· NumPy: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions.

· pandas: Offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

· matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

· seaborn: Built on top of matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

· scikit-learn: A machine learning library that includes simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

· TensorFlow and PyTorch: Libraries for deep learning and neural network-based models.`,
  },
  {
    title:
      "3. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
    desc: "In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the input comes with corresponding output labels, and the goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Examples include regression and classification tasks. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, and the goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the data. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.",
  },
  {
    title: "4. What is data preprocessing, and why is it important?",
    desc: "Data preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis or machine learning. It includes tasks such as handling missing values, normalizing or scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and removing duplicates. It's crucial because well-preprocessed data can lead to better model performance and more accurate results.",
  },
  {
    title: "5. What is the purpose of exploratory data analysis (EDA)?",
    desc: "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. The purpose of EDA is to understand the data's structure, spot anomalies or patterns, test assumptions, and inform further data preparation or feature engineering steps. It helps in making informed decisions about the choice of algorithms and the overall approach to analysis.",
  },
  {
    title: "6. How do you handle missing data in a dataset?",
    desc: `Handling missing data can be approached in several ways:
    
· Imputation: Filling in missing values with estimates, such as the mean, median, or mode of the column.

· Interpolation: Using methods like linear interpolation to estimate missing values.

· Deletion: Removing rows or columns with missing values, though this can lead to loss of information.

· Model-based methods: Using algorithms or models to predict and fill in missing values based on other data.`,
  },
  {
    title:
      "7. What are some common evaluation metrics for machine learning models?",
    desc: `Common evaluation metrics include:
    
· Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.

· Precision: The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.

· Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

· F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between them.

· ROC-AUC: Measures the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, useful for binary classification problems.

· Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE): Metrics for regression tasks that measure the average magnitude of errors.`,
